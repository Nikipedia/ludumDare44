My game for LD 44
All of this work was done or assembled by me starting 27/4/19 at 11am, as well as all the texture, sound and music (yes I did make the piano recordings) assets. 
I did get some inspiration and parts of the player movement class from a unity LWRP preset, which is (according to the LD rules) allowed.
